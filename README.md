# The Coders Website

This website was made as a practice for HTML and CSS development. It's not a real website nor a real band. 

## Pages included

* Home page with Tour information.
* Store page with Albums, Merch and Cart.
* About page with Bio and Social Media.

Some links and functionality are disabled since it falls out of the scope of the project.
